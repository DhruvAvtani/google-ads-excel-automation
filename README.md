# Google Ads to Excel Automation

### Project for CodeVerse Hackathon

## Problem Statement
Digital marketers and businesses spend hours every week manually downloading Google Ads data, cleaning it, and preparing Excel reports for analysis.  
This process is repetitive, time-consuming, and error-prone.

## Our Solution
We are building an *automated workflow* that connects *Google Ads API* to *Excel reports*.  
The tool will:
- Fetch campaign performance data (impressions, clicks, CTR, conversions, cost, ROI, etc.) directly from Google Ads.
- Process and clean the data automatically.
- Generate ready-to-use Excel reports with tables, pivot charts, and visualizations.
- Save time, improve accuracy, and make digital marketing analysis effortless.

## Why We Built This
Marketing teams should focus on *strategy and insights*, not on repetitive reporting work.  
By automating this workflow, we:
- Save hours of manual effort.
- Ensure accuracy of reports.
- Provide quick insights for decision-making.
- Enable scheduling for daily/weekly automated reports.

## Who Can Use This
- Digital marketing agencies  
- Small & medium businesses  
- Data analysts  
- Enterprises running multiple ad campaigns  

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- *Python* – for scripting and data processing  
- *Google Ads API* – for fetching ad performance data  
- *Pandas* – for data cleaning and transformation  
- *OpenPyXL / XlsxWriter* – for Excel report generation  
- *(Optional) Streamlit/Flask* – for a simple user interface  

## Repository Status
This repository is created as part of *CodeVerse Hackathon*.  
Development is in progress. Code will be uploaded soon.
